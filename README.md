# Submitting and Tracking Requests
File an [issue](https://github.com/osic/osic-clouds-requests/issues) in this repo and fill out the template. The Governance Board will review, vote and respond. Once you have access, come back here to the osic-clouds repo for tools tips and more.

> Why did we make a separate repo for requests? The github template function only allows for one template per repo. Plus, it keeps all requests separate from any work issues that may come up here.

Please complete and submit the form to request access today. All submissions will be reviewed on a monthly basis, and dispositioned using the criteria below. Availability will depend on current utilization rates.
